# Challagen: Learn in pratice Object Oriented Programming

## 📚 Object Oriented Programming Paradigm (OOP)

The Objet Oriented (OO) vision is that of a world in which objects interact with each other in many different ways.
This paradigm is an analysis, design and programming model based on the approximation between the real world and the virtual world, through the creation and interaction between Classes, Attributes, Methods, Objects, among others.
There are four main pillars of OOP: **Abstraction**, **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance** and **Polymorphism**

### 🔺 ABSTRACTION:

Ability to concentrate on the essential aspects of a domain, ignoring less important or incidental features. In this context, objects are abstractions of existing entities in the domain in question.

### 🔺 ENCAPSULATION:

Encapsulating means hiding the implementation of objects. Encapsulation mainly favors two aspects of a system: maintenance and evolution.

### 🔺 HERITAGE:

Allows you to define a child class that reuses (inherits), extends, or modifies the behavior of a parent class. The class whose members are inherited is called the base class. The class that inherits the members of the base class is called a derived class.

### 🔺 POLYMORPHISM:

The ability of an object to be referenced in multiple ways. Careful, polymorphism does not mean that the object keeps changing, quite the contrary, an object is born of a type and dies of that type, what can change is the way we refer to it. The ability to treat objects created from specific classes as objects of a generic class is called polymorphism.

## 📚 CONCEITOS FUNDAMENTAIS POO

### 🔻 DOMAIN:

The application domain, also known as the business or business objects layer, is where the classes that are part of the problem domain are located, that is, classes corresponding to objects that are part of the problem description.

### 🔻 CLASS:

An element of code that has the function of representing objects in the real world. Within it, it is common to declare attributes and methods, which represent, respectively, the characteristics and behaviors of that object.

### 🔻 ATTRIBUTE:

Attributes are basically the data structure that will represent the class. Attributes are also known as CLASS VARIABLE, and can be divided into two basic types: instance and class attributes.

### 🔻 VARIABLE:

A “region of memory (of the computer) previously identified whose purpose is to store the data or information of a program for a certain period of time”.

### 🔻 METHOD:

Methods represent the states and actions of objects and classes.

### 🔻 OBJECT:

In OOP, an object is a "mold" of a given class, which comes into existence from an instance of the class. The class defines the behavior of the object, using attributes (properties) and methods (actions). Object in computer science, is a reference to a memory location that has a value. An object can be a variable, function, or data structure.

### 🔻 INSTANCE:

An instance of a class is a new object created from that class, with the new operator. To instantiate a class is to create a new object of the same type as that class. A class can only be used after it has been instantiated.
